#### 1.Developed a clue game using Java, following the SOLID Principles of Object-Oriented design and utilized the Unified Modeling Language (UML) to clarify and display the software design.
#### 2.Used AWT and Swing libraries to create the game UI, displaying the board states and receiving user input.
#### 3.Utilized a complex recursive method to find all targets dynamically and constructed the game path.
#### 4.Implemented a greedy-based playing strategy for the five computer players to play against the human player.
#### 5.Utilized JUnit and followed Agile Development and Test-driven Development in the software lifecycle.
