//	Methods (minimum 5) to test target creation on a 4x4 board (see examples below)
//	Test for behavior on empty 4x4 board.
//	Test for behavior with at least one cell being flagged as occupied.  A player cannot move into an occupied cell.
//	Test for behavior with at least one cell being flagged as a room.   A player used up all movement points upon entering a room.
