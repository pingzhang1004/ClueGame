//Is the players name and color correct?

//What are the requirements for a correct deal?
	
//All cards should be dealt.
//The other cards are dealt to the players.
	
	
//All players should have roughly the same number of cards
	
//The same card should not be given to >1 player
	
//Deck size could easily change (e.g., we could add more weapons). So try to avoid hard-coding # of cards/player.
